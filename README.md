## If I were CEO

I would also expand my services into different countries. I would offer the $0 transaction free, but give an international charge for trades.
* Expanding in these areas would not only lead to a  biggest customer base, but also the assets that we would be managing. In the expansion I would integrate new software such as Akamai, Amazon EC2, and NGINX. With these new advancements id be able to store our clients information and transaction history in the cloud, and have operating systems as we increase by the number.
